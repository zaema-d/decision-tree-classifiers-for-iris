# Iris Dataset Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview

This project is focused on building and visualizing a Decision Tree classifier using the famous Iris dataset. The classifier is trained to categorize iris flowers into one of three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Objective

- Train a Decision Tree classifier to understand the decision-making process of the model.
- Visualize the Decision Tree to interpret how the model makes predictions.
- Evaluate the classifier's performance on test data.
- Make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species and four features each. It is widely used for machine learning as a beginner's dataset for classification problems.

## Implementation

The implementation is done in Python, using libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning and Matplotlib for visualization. The following steps are included:

1. **Data Loading**: The Iris dataset is loaded into the environment.
2. **Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and test sets.
3. **Model Training**: A Decision Tree classifier is trained on the dataset.
4. **Visualization**: The trained Decision Tree is visualized in the notebook.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy score.
6. **Prediction**: New sample data points are fed to the classifier to predict the class labels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Usage

To run the project, execute the provided Jupyter Notebook in a Python environment with the necessary packages installed. The notebook includes all steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Results

The trained Decision Tree model demonstrates high accuracy on the test data and is capable of making predictions for new data samples. The tree visualization helps in understanding the decision paths taken by the model.
